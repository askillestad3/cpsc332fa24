<h1>About me!!!</h1>
<h3>An Introduction:</h3>
<p>I am a junior at Gonzaga University, majoring in Computer Science with a strong passion for front-end software development. 
    With experience in languages such as C, C++, Kotlin, Java, Python, SQL, and HTML, I enjoy bringing my designs to 
    life and solving any challenges with innovative solutions. My academic journey has enhanced my skills in both back-end and 
    front-end development, giving me a comprehensive understanding of the software development process. I am eager to contribute to 
    even more projects, collaborate with peers and future coworkers, and continue expanding my knowledge in the tech world.
